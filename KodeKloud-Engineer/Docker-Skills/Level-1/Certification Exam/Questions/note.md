Questions removed for privacy and integrity of exam.

This exam was 9 questions of different weights.

Most the questions were rooted in understanding the level 1 task, while a few others were requiring of a deeper understanding of docker, but closer to a mid-teir.

I did found the last question to be well outside the topics covered in this level and an advanced feature I have rarely interacted with, and while I tried, I could not get it correct.
